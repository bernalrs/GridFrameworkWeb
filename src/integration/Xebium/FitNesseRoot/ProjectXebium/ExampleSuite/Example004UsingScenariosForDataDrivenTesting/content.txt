!3 Using an existing scenario for data driven testing by providing multiple values
'''Executed steps:
1. Open the current page in a browser.
2. Open a menu item from the menu bar (on the left side of the screen) by providing its name replacing the variable ''@menuItem''.
3. Verify the correct page header is shown on top of the opened page by providing it replacing the variable ''@pageTitle''.'''

!3 1. Create a scenario taking two variables ''menuItem'' and ''pageTitle''
!| scenario | open menu item | menuItem | and verify the page header | pageHeader |
| start browser | firefox | on url | http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/ |
| ensure | do | open | on | ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |
| ensure | do | waitForTitle | on | ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |
| ensure | do | clickAndWait | on | link=@menuItem |
| ensure | do | verifyText | on | css=span.page_type | with | @pageHeader |
| stop browser |
'''When adding the above scenario to the [[Scenario Library][.ProjectXebium.ScenarioLibrary]] (which is a Fitnesse special page type) it can be called from anywhere in the hierarchy of your Fitnesse project'''
!3 2. A single test using the scenario would look like this:
!| script |
| open menu item | Test History | and verify the page header | Test History for ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |
!3 3. For data driven testing do not use the ''script'' table, just create a table containing the scenario name, with on the second row the variable names, on each following row unique value replacing the variables:
'''All steps of the test will be executed for each provided row with values'''
| open menu item and verify the page header |
| menuItem | pageHeader |
| Edit | Edit Page: |
| Properties | Page Properties |
| Where Used | Where Used Results |
| Refactor | Refactor |

'''After running this test the script that was executed is provided per step behind the executed values'''
