!3 Extending a scenario to use variable input
'''Executed steps:
1. Open the current page in a browser.
2. wait for the page title to appear.
3. Verify a text variable text (replacing the variable ''@verifiedText'') is shown somewhere on the page.'''

!3 1. Take the ''scenario'' (as it is used in Example 002) and change the logical name to ''verify page contains text'' and add a variable name ''verifiedText''
!3 2. In the scenario add the variable preceded by an @ sign
!| scenario | verify page contains text | verifiedText |
| start browser | firefox | on url | http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/ |
| ensure | do | open | on | ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |
| ensure | do | waitForTitle | on | ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |
| ensure | do | verifyTextPresent | on | @verifiedText |
| stop browser |
'''When adding the above scenario to the [[Scenario Library][.ProjectXebium.ScenarioLibrary]] (which is a Fitnesse special page type) it can be called from anywhere in the hierarchy of your Fitnesse project'''

!3 3. Now the ''scenario'' can be executed from the testcase by providing the scenario name and any given value, in this case ''Xebium''
| script |
| verify page contains text | Xebium |

'''After running the test the script that was executed with the actual values provided is displayed by expanding the collapsible section'''
